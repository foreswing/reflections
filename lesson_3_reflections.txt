When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all of your work local?

	If you make some changes on a computer different than the one containing your local repository or if you have other folks contributing to your repository work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Similar to why you want to commit "logical" changes ... you may want to do the same thing using Git and since it won't know automatically what you determine is a logical pull point, then you would want to do this manually.
